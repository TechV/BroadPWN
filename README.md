BroadPWN
======

An expoit [originally described here](https://blog.exodusintel.com/2017/07/26/broadpwn/) with this many devices are left vulnerable. However for my purposes I only truely care about a select handfull these.

##Progress so far

As of this time the exploit currently makes the Nitnendo Switch crash upon connecting with error code 2107-0401 and that's all I have to report at this time ;)
